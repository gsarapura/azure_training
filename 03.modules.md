# Outputs
Outputs are a way for your Bicep code to send data back to whoever or whatever started the deployment.

`output appServiceAppName string = appServiceAppName`

- *output*: The output keyword tells Bicep you're defining an output.
- *appServiceAppName*: the output's name. When someone deploys the template successfully, the output values will include the name you specified so they can access the values they're expecting.
- *string*: the output type. Bicep outputs support the same types as _parameters_.
- A value must be specified for each output. Unlike parameters, outputs *always* need to have values. Output values can be expressions, references to parameters or variables, or properties of resources that are deployed within the file.

## Tip
Outputs can use the same names as variables and parameters. This convention can be helpful if you construct a complex expression within a variable to use within your template's resources, and you also need to expose the variable's value as an output.

This one will have its value set to the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of a public IP address resource.
`output ipFqdn string = publicIPAddress.properties.dnsSettings.fqdn`

# Build a Module
When you want the template to include a reference to a module file, use the module keyword. A module definition looks similar to a resource declaration, but instead of including a resource type and API version, you'll use the module's file name:

```
module myModule 'modules/mymodule.bicep' = {
  name: 'MyModule'
  params: {
    location: location
  }
}
```
